## Accessibility Steward
I am a firm believer that all information and technology should be accessible to everyone. Driven by the cognitive challenges that are encountered everyday is what makes me wake up in the moring.
Accessibility is the reason why I was able to see the similarities in other individuals that have cognitive challenges, invisible disabilities and that were ultimately neurodivergent.
My/Our goal is to ensure that information is in fact accessible in all forms across all roles within organizations.

## Speaking Oppurtunities
I'm always willing to speak at conferences and company meetings when possible. The talks can be open conversations about how processes can allow for everyone to feel included.
Inclusion is a concept that when looked upon from it's most fundamental level is where everyone feels they have a voice, processes in place to help overcome barriers and education to aid those in 
understanding the challenges encoutered by neurodivergent organizational team members.
